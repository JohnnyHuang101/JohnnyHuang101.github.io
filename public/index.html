      content="Hi! âœ¨âœ¨ I'm Johnny, and welcome to my profile! ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ I'm currently a Junior at Washington University in St. Louis, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science + Mathematics. Originally from ShenZhen China, I moved to the U.S. at age 12 and grew up in the Bay Area (specifically around San Mateo & Foster City). Fun fact: I have an identical twin brother, Johnson, whoâ€™s also studying CS and Math at UC Berkeley! My primary interests lie in computer vision and generative AI, and Iâ€™m enthusiastic about leveraging these fields to build tangible solutions. I have hands-on experience as a full-stack developer, where I deployed end-to-end ML tools using Python and framworks like OpenCV, Pytorch, Tensorflow, and Huggingface. Additionally, I have a strong background in data analytics, including work with databases including MariaDB, Postgre, NoSQL and financial analysis algorithms using tools like R and MATLAB. I also have experience with computing using tools like PySpark and Scala on the cloud using tools such as AWS, Docker, and Azure. I built this simple portfolio using JS, HTML, Node, and React to showcase a few of my projects. They're pretty cool, so please check them out on my GitHub! ðŸ˜„"
