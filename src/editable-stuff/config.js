    "Hi, Iâ€™m Johnny â€” welcome to my portfolio! ðŸ˜„\n\nIâ€™m currently a Senior at Washington University in St. Louis, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science + Mathematics, and will be continuing for an M.S. in Computer Science in Spring 2026.\n\nOriginally from Shenzhen, China, I moved to the U.S. at age 12 and grew up in the Bay Area (Foster City). A fun fact: I have an identical twin brother, Johnson, whoâ€™s also studying CS and Mathâ€”at UC Berkeley!\n\nMy main interests lie in software engineering, especially building highly scalable and efficient systems, services, and databases. I also enjoy applying ML solutions in meaningful, production-ready settings (ie. RAG search systems). I have hands-on experience as a full-stack developer, building fast and resilient web servers and designing scalable SQL and NoSQL databases.\n\nIâ€™ve also worked on end-to-end machine learning tools, including validation pipelines and agent-based systems powered by LLMs. Additionally, Iâ€™m familiar with cloud platforms like AWS and managing microservices using Docker containers.\n\nThis portfolio was built using JavaScript, Node, and React to highlight a few of my projects. Theyâ€™re pretty coolâ€”check them out! More details are on my GitHub!",
